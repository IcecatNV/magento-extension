Select Specific Brands

- When choosing this option, unique brand names will be populated based on the Brand Name attribute that has already been mapped in the "Icecat Configuration" section. You can then import product data specifically for these selected brands.

In this case, only products from the Magento catalog belonging to the Apple and Braun brands will be considered for importing product data from Icecat. Which means, products from other brands, such as HP, will not be imported.

Important Note: After making any configuration changes, flushing the Magento Cache is strongly recommended.
