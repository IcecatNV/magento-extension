    ![img1](./doc/images/image26.png)

- Icecat Configuration - One time attribute mapping is required to import the data via Icecat API. These attributes are created by the end user in the Magento environment and the icecat extension will use these attributes to match the product in the Icecat catalog.

    Notes:
    - The attributes scope must be global and of type text.
    - The attributes must be part of the attribute set used for the magento product catalog.
    ![img1](./doc/images/image29.png)

- Icecat Categorization - Once enabled, a one time new root category named “Icecat Categories” will be created without any impact on the Default Category. The Icecat Categories then could be utilized as per need, for example - by assigning to the required store into General Configurations or by moving specific categories to the Default Category.

- Icecat Media - Images and YouTube videos -only public- are imported into the Magento’s default “Images And Videos'' section. If more than one store is configured, the user will see all the images and videos in the Default Store View.  However, once a particular store view is enabled, images and videos will be active for that store view and all the images and videos from other stores views will be marked as hidden. 

    All the documents are stored in the table icecat_product_attachtment.

- Icecat Other Enriched Fields - Icecat Product Reviews are stored in the table icecat_product_reviews. All the remaining fields are Magento attributes and have been created by default during the Icecat extension installation.

    Delta Import takes all the products which have been updated in the Magento product catalog since the last full/automatic import run.
